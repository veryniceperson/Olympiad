        <b>1.</b> Washing your hands often
    </h3>

    <p>
        <img src="Images/Hand washing image.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 3%; margin-bottom: 5%;" width="30%" height="auto">
        Washing your hands is one of the most important things you can do in order to keep yourself and others safe. Your hands are full of microscopic organisms, because you touch many contaminated things everyday. 
        It's just a part of your life. Moreover, you touch your face, eyes, mouth, nose and ears with your hands. You wouldn't want to do that with hands that are contaminated with various diseases, because those parts 
        of your body are the main entry points for disease. So wash your hands often, like after you visit the bathroom, before you eat or prepare, after having a trip outside and even after using your phone. Just make sure that you 
        wash your hands before you touch any of the body's disease main entry points (mouth, eyes, nose and ears). If hand washing isn't avaliable you can use alcohol based disinfectants.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 3%;">
       <b>2.</b> Preparing foods and drinks safely
    </h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 9%;"> 
      <img src="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-67569905/67569905.jpg?940189" style="float: right; margin-left:2%;" width="30%" height="auto">
        Microscopic organisms such as germs quickly grow on food and if not handled/prepared properly, the person which consumes the food might contract an infection and suffer things like vomiting and diarrhea. 
        You should keep surfaces clean (such as cutting boards), wash fruits and vegetables and cook food at appropriate temperatures. In addition, don't leave food out and keep it inside a refrigerator in order to maintan 
        safety.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 3%;">
        <b>3.</b> Cough or sneeze into your elbow
    </h3>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 7%;">
        <img src="https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/man-in-mid-cough-demonstrating-proper-hygienic-procedure-picture-id93458614?k=6&m=93458614&s=612x612&w=0&h=QaDsmLNdv3vt_hfmnc35R3TiDIYFJef_nqVs7SGUo2U=" style="float: right; margin-left:2%;" width="30%" height="auto">
        You should cough or sneeze into your elbow instead of your hands, because you are likely to touch something or someone else after you have sneezed and you have a high chance of infecting someone. On the other hand, whenever you cough/sneeze into your elbow 
        you have a low chance of infecting someone, because this method effectively blocks all microscopic organisms that come out as you sneeze. 
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 3%;">
        <b>4.</b> Don't share personal items
    </h3>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 7%;">
        It is highly recommended that you don't personal objects such as toothbrushes, towels, razors and especially needles. It is very easy to get infected through these objects if they are contaminated and in order to stay safe, only use your personal objects. 
        You should also remember that you should use needles only once and throw them away afterwards.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 3%;">
      <b>5.</b> Make sure you clean commonly used surfaces
    </h3>

      You should make sure that you wipe surface that are commonly used with a napkin and some kind of disinfectant regularly (once a week), especially in kitchens and bathrooms, because there are greater deals of microscopic organisms there. 
      In addition you should clean your toilet and shower, bath and sink with some kind of disinfectant such as toilet cleaner solution and soap and water. This control the growth of microscopic organisms and slows their population growth, as bacteria and fungus grow at a faster rate in moist places. 
      In addition, if someone in your home is ill, make sure you regulary disinfect surfaces that they come on contact with, so others don't get infected.

      <img style="float: right ; margin-left:2%;" width="10%" height="auto" src="Images/Stay home image.png">
      Do not visit someone if they are sick, even while they aren't home, because you would have a very high chance of getting infected. Instead tell them to stay home and treat themselves using appropriate methods. If you have no choice, make sure you visit them 
      while maintaining appropriate precautions such as wearing a mask, maintain a distance with them and washing yourself after visiting them, in order to reduce the chances of contracting their disease.

      You should avoid contact with wild animals because they might be contaminated with parasites such as ticks and have a chance of carrying a communicable disease, such as rabies. 
      Coming in contact with wild animals puts you and your pet at risk of infection of both microscopic organisms and parasites, why is why you must avoid it at all times.
