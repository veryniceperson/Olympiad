    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 3%;">This webpage will guide you on what you should do if you suspect that you or someone else is infected.

      <strong>If you or someone is having a life-threatining situation, make sure to call the emergency services right away.</strong>
    </h2>

    <ol>
      <li>First of all, make sure to cancel any meetups with other people, because you have a chance of infecting them. If you live with someone that is infected, you should assume that you are infected as well and take the same precautions.</li>
      <li>If your symptoms aren't very serious (light cough, runny nose, sore throat, headaches, etc) you should stay at home and treat yourself using appropriate methods (paracetamol, throat lozenges, cough drops, etc). Make sure that you don't visit anyone or have them visit you.</li>
      <li>If you live with other people, make sure that you stay in a specific room, such as your bedroom. This would reduce the risks of other people getting infected. In addition, it is recommended that you use a seperate bathroom and wear a mask whenever you walk in other parts of the house.
      <li>If your symptops are serious (severe headaches, diarrhea, frequent vomiting, temperature above 38CÂ°, etc) go to the hospital. Make sure to not contact anyone and take precautions to not infect others, such as wearing a mask and gloves.</li>
      <li>If you are going to the hospital, it is recommended that you notify your doctor or the hospital ahead of time and do not use public transport and instead use your own car. If you do not have a method of personal transportation, contact the hospital for an ambulance. </li>
      <li>Make sure that you get tested for your infection at the hospital, so healthcare workers would be able to treat you using efficient methods and so you would know how to avoid contracting the same disease again in the future.</li>
    </ol>
